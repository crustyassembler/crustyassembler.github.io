</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Any project which has been both conceived and approved in my workplace is subject to compliance with an in-house operating model which intends to ensure that all solutions developed in the workplace are done so in an efficient and professional manner. The operating model employs a combination of both iterative and incremental development principles and as such at regular intervals during the development of any solution, the needs of the customer are re-evaluated and if necessary a request for change can be made; potentially influencing the repetition of the entire process until the solution is deemed to be complete by the developing team, governance, testing, and the client. For this reason, I would liken the software development lifecycle implemented by my employer to the incremental lifecycle.</p>
<p>The cycle consists of (at minimum); the approval from Planning Lead based in part on a two-page opportunity statement, the creation and evaluation of a project proposal, and plan with complexity relative to its scope. Continuous development then follows; segmented with regular evaluations of project requirements, testing and the potential implementation of any significant requests for change approved by the change advisory board or smaller bug-fixes and minor feature implementations.</p>
<p>The design authority exists to ensure that the appropriate technical approach is taken in order to solve any given issue when producing a project design specification as is required. The design authority has the authority to either approve or reject proposed designs based on whether or not the project design specification complies with any given standard or is deemed by them to be an appropriate solution for the task on hand.</p>
<p>When it is determined through these rigorous processes that the project meets all proposed requirements, the project is deployed as is appropriate. This usually consists of first being implemented in a testing environment, which allows any involved customers to determine whether or not the solution is fit for their consumption and is free of any bugs that are likely to negatively impact their experience when employing the solution as appropriate.</p>
<p>Following this often lengthy procedure, the entire process is reviewed, with all involved parties considering how the process could potentially be improved and which stages of development were handled effectively. Additionally, the benefits of the developed solution are evaluated, determining whether or not the project was a worthwhile investment of resources, and how the solution could be implemented in the most effective way.</p>
<p>Following the implementation of a solution in accordance with the operating model, maintenance is delegated to a disparate team solely responsible for providing customer support for solutions previously implemented. When change is called for, control is passed back to the development team as is appropriate and the entire cycle is repeated.</p>                </article>
