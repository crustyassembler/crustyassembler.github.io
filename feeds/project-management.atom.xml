responsibilities. This includes the project board, which is one of the defined
groups encompassing the following roles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Executives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An executive acts as a single point of accountability for a project and is
responible for designing and apponting the Project Management Team. They develop
the business case at the start of the project and is constantly evauluating the
value of the project in relation to any invested resources. Executives are
generally appointed by either Corporate or Programme Management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Senior Users&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of the Senior User is to bridge the gap between the Users and the Project
Management Team, providing valuable communication between the two distinct
entities. Additionally, they provide the Project Team with a list of requirements
to work towards and implement in their solutions, ensuring that the functionality
of the project is in line with the needs of the Users in terms of both ease of
use and quality. The responsibilities fulfilled by the Senior Users are
comparable to those of a Business Advisor in the DSDM project life-cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Senior Suppliers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senior Supplier is responsible for the delivery of any necessary resources
required for the continuous progression of the project. The Senior Supplier can
either come from the customer organisation or from a supplier. The role involves
ensuring that the right tools, knowledge and equipment are available to those who
need it during the development of the solution. Suppliers may be subcontracted or
otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One project management technique adopted by the PRINCE2 paradigm is project
assurance. It aims to provide an independent view of how the project is
progressing from the perspective of the customer and any potential adopters of
the produced solution. The aforementioned roles are all responsible for providing
assurance in relation to their roles in the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Executive is responsible for ensuring whether the business aspects of the
project are correct and that the project continues to provide good value relative
to investment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Senior User is responsible for ensuring that the project stays on track and
continues to meet user requirements throughout the project. They also ensure that
the end product will be fit for purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Senior Supplier is responsible for ensuring that the resources, tools and
knowledge required by the whole team will be available throughout the development
of the solution. They also evaluate whether the project's time and funding
targets are on track to be met or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Project Board and the individuals assigned to manage project
assurance, there must also be a person or group responsible for Change
Management. The individuals responsible for this are referred to as Change
Authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The responsibilities of the Change Authority include approving or disapproving
change requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a whole, the project board is responsible for the success or failure of the
project. They are responsible for providing any required resources or funds in
order for the project to succeed in addition to support, direction and ensuring
effective communication between the project team and the stakeholders. The roles
fulfilled by the Project Board may be interpreted as those of Project Management
when compared to alternative project SDLC implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As PRINCE2 provides a structured approach to project management, defining a
method of managing projects within a rigid predefined framework, it is very clear
which responsibilities fall into any individual's domain within the project,
making it extremely clear as to who is accountable for what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abundance of documentation required in order to correctly adhere to the
PRINCE2 framework is beneficial in that it provides a degree of clarity
throughout the project that no other framework provides, allowing anyone involved
with the project to know at any one time exactly what is happening within the
project. On the other hand, the sheer quantity of documentation required can 
potentially be more than necessary, or even completely unrealistic depending on
the scale of the project itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One disadvantage of PRINCE2 is its lack of accessibility. Due to the sheer scale
of the specification, it is difficult, especially for those involved with smaller
projects, to appropriately tailor the framework in order for it to work
efficiently with their project. This is often an issue because the amount of
documentation required to be produced as standard in order to adhere to the
specification is often far more than is necessary or appropriate, especially for
projects of a smaller size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</summary><category term="Management"></category></entry></feed>
