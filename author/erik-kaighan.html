</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Documentation provided by my employer claims that successful projects
are delivered by a "One Team" approach, incorporating a DSDM-based
project management plan within the organisation.</p>
<p>The roles defined in the project management plan are stated to be
flexible in the sense that they may be carried out either internally or
externally as appropriate. The roles, and consequently their associated
responsibilities may also be shared by multiple individuals.</p>
<p>The following project role diagram aims to illustrate the
relationships between individual roles and responsibilities documented
within the DSDM development lifecycle specification.</p>
